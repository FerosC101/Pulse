# API Keys Security Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Added Environment Variable Support**
- ✅ Added `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` to `pubspec.yaml`
- ✅ Added `.env` to assets in `pubspec.yaml`
- ✅ Loaded dotenv in `main.dart`

### 2. **Secured API Keys**
- ✅ **Gemini API Key**: Moved from hardcoded to `.env` file
  - Updated `lib/services/gemini_ai_service.dart` to use `dotenv.env['GEMINI_API_KEY']`
  
- ✅ **Google Maps API Key**: Already in `.env` file
  - Android: `AndroidManifest.xml` (line 18)
  - Web: `web/index.html` (line 20)

### 3. **Protected Sensitive Files**
- ✅ Added `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local` to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template for team members

### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ Created `SETUP.md` with complete setup instructions
- ✅ Included API key acquisition steps
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section

## 📝 Current API Keys Location

### In `.env` file (SECURED - Not committed to Git):
```properties
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBgePDAyyEv2c4OR-iMxY1P_ge6QDOsC8s
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDsqyQ_IlhJfjzGN6YXNONMq3e0c87RqEk
```

### Still Hardcoded (Need Manual Update):
1. **Android**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (line 18)
   - Currently: `AIzaSyDsqyQ_IlhJfjzGN6YXNONMq3e0c87RqEk`
   - ⚠️ For production, consider using build variants with different API keys

2. **Web**: `web/index.html` (line 20)
   - Currently: `AIzaSyDsqyQ_IlhJfjzGN6YXNONMq3e0c87RqEk`
   - ⚠️ Must be updated manually for each environment

3. **Firebase Config**: `lib/firebase_options.dart`
   - These are Firebase API keys (different from Maps/Gemini)
   - ✅ These are safe to commit as they're restricted by Firebase Security Rules

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ Environment variables stored in `.env` file
2. ✅ `.env` file added to `.gitignore`
3. ✅ Template file `.env.example` provided for team
4. ✅ Documentation created in `SETUP.md`
5. ✅ Gemini API key now loaded from environment

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### For New Team Members:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your own API keys
3. Run `flutter pub get`
4. Follow `SETUP.md` instructions

### For Production:
1. Use different API keys for dev/staging/production
2. Consider using server-side API key management
3. Restrict API keys in Google Cloud Console:
   - Android: Restrict to app package name
   - Web: Restrict to your domain
   - Set daily quotas

### Platform-Specific Notes:

**Android**: 
- API key is in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- For environment-based builds, consider using Gradle flavor configurations

**Web**:
- API key is directly in `web/index.html`
- Cannot use `.env` in production web builds
- Consider using environment variables during build process

**iOS**:
- Check `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` for Firebase keys
- For Maps, would need to add to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Set up environment-based builds** (dev/staging/prod)
2. **Use Flutter flavors** for different API keys per environment
3. **Implement server-side key management** for production
4. **Set up CI/CD** with secret environment variables
5. **Enable API key restrictions** in Google Cloud Console

## 📦 Files Modified

1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_dotenv dependency and .env asset
2. `lib/main.dart` - Added dotenv.load()
3. `lib/services/gemini_ai_service.dart` - Changed to use dotenv
4. `.env` - Created with actual API keys (GITIGNORED)
5. `.gitignore` - Added .env files
6. `.env.example` - Created template
7. `SETUP.md` - Created documentation

## ✅ Verification

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Check that .env is not tracked by git
git status

# Run the app
flutter run
```

The app should work exactly as before, but now API keys are secured! 🎉
