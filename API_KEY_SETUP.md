# 🔑 API Key Setup Guide

## ⚠️ URGENT: Gemini API Key Leaked

Your Gemini API key was reported as leaked and has been disabled by Google for security reasons.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Get a New Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Get API Key"** or **"Create API Key"**
4. Click **"Create API key in new project"** or select an existing project
5. Copy the generated API key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

### 2. Update Your .env File

1. Open the file: `d:\coding\flutter\gene\.env`
2. Find the line: `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`
3. Replace `YOUR_NEW_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your new API key
4. **IMPORTANT**: Save the file

Example:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restart Your Flutter App

```powershell
# Stop the current app (press 'q' in terminal or Ctrl+C)
# Then run again:
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Keep your `.env` file in `.gitignore` (already configured)
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share API keys in screenshots
- Commit `.env` file to public repositories
- Use the same key across multiple projects
- Hardcode API keys in source code

## 🎯 What's Fixed
